Reinforcement Learning (Deep Quality Network) 

Task is to balance the pole on the cart for as long as possible and reward the agent if it is able to keep the stick 
stable.  

Agent will decide whether to move the cart left or right based on the position of the stick on top of it.

The working code of this will be present in the train.py file and the resources used to implement is linked [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)
