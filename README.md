# projects

This repository contains mini projects implemented using various different architecture or models. Most of the projects will be just direct implemetation of someone else work which I will link in this readme overtime. 
Projects will mostly be implemented using PyTorch but some vanilla python implementation is on the way for few interesting ideas.

Acronym Architecture/Models:
  1. RL: Reinforcement Learning
  

Projects(Project name, architecture or model, branch name):
